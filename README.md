Crop Diseases Detection and Crop Recommendation
This repository contains the implementation of a crop disease detection and crop recommendation system using Google Colab. The project leverages deep learning techniques to detect diseases in crops based on images and recommends suitable crops based on various environmental factors.

Project Overview
This project focuses on two key agricultural challenges:

Crop Disease Detection: Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we detect diseases in crops from images of their leaves.
Crop Recommendation: Based on environmental conditions (such as soil quality, temperature, and humidity), we recommend the most suitable crops for a given region.
The goal of this project is to assist farmers in making informed decisions about both treating crop diseases and choosing the most appropriate crops to plant.

Technologies Used
Python
Google Colab
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV
Pandas & Numpy
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Setup and Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-disease-detection.git
Open the project in Google Colab:

Upload the notebook.ipynb file or open it from your GitHub directly in Colab.
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
!pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure that the dataset is available in the correct format and directory structure before running the notebook.

Dataset
The project uses two datasets:

Crop Disease Dataset: Images of leaves with labeled diseases.
Environmental Dataset: Data on soil quality, temperature, and humidity to recommend crops.
You can download the datasets from Dataset Link (provide dataset source here) and place them in the appropriate directories.

Model Architecture
Disease Detection
The disease detection model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify crop images into the following categories:

Healthy
Diseased (specific diseases)
The CNN architecture includes:

Convolutional Layers: For feature extraction
MaxPooling Layers: For down-sampling
Fully Connected Layers: For classification
Crop Recommendation
The recommendation system uses a decision tree model that takes input features such as soil pH, temperature, and rainfall to suggest crops suited to these conditions.

Training and Testing
Disease Detection Model:
Training set: 80% of the dataset
Testing set: 20% of the dataset
Accuracy: (Add results here after training)
Crop Recommendation System:
Uses environmental data to recommend crops based on predefined conditions.
Both models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Usage
For Crop Disease Detection:

Upload an image of the crop leaf in the Colab notebook.
Run the detection cell to get the prediction of whether the crop is healthy or diseased.
For Crop Recommendation:

Input environmental data (soil pH, temperature, etc.) into the notebook.
Run the recommendation cell to get a list of suggested crops.
Results
(Add details about the modelâ€™s performance here, including confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and sample outputs.)
